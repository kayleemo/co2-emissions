# CO2 Emissions Per Capita

## Background
We have all grown up hearing about climate change and the dangers it imposes on our society. Politicians continue to argue whether climate change exists and/or is a pressing issue, yet, the negative impacts of climate change are now getting harder to ignore. Growing up in Oregon, I saw the impacts climate change had on my state, including extreme wildfires that were once rare that now occur every summer and is the norm. I believe it is more important now than ever that we, as a society, learn about climate change and the tragic effects. I wanted to explore the issue on a global level, and that started with analysis on CO2 emissions for countries and regions across the world. 

## Data Source
I used a data source from Kaggle called CO2 Emissions Around the World. The data included 215 countries as well as the region they were in. The data also included CO2 emissions per capita for each year from 1990-2019. CO2 emissions were measured by metric tons per capita.

## Findings
For this analysis, I looked at CO2 emissions from a world view, to a regional view, and to a country view.
